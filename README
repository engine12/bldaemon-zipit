Manages screen and keyboard backlights:
  -turns them off when lid is closed and on when lid is opened
  -dims them when on battery and brightens them when on AC (or reverse)
  -respects changes made to brightness while running

Thanks to Russell K. Davis for lid switch and AC
plug detection routines, and help
